These collaborations have been a way for us to innovate, experiment and learn whilst working with visually rich subject matter and diverse narratives. It is through this ongoing belief in the importance of working with artists that we continue to develop Mural as a tool that can be used by anyone as a means of creative expression and the sharing of complex ideas and stories online. With the latest version of Mural we wanted to work with artists whose work and ideas would help raise our aspirations and understanding of sustainable creative practice. This included the use of environmentally friendly materials but it also involved gaining a better understanding of the environmental impact of emerging technologies. During the development of Mural 2 - with support from Grant for the Web - and the commissioned artworks, there has been an exponential growth in the use of alternative currencies and ways of proving your ownership of artworks through NFT\u2019s (Non Fungible Tokens). So, it feels very important to us to have introduced a way of financially supporting artistic content online via the use of web monetization with Mural 2. Coil is a service that makes use of the emerging web monetization protocol to stream micropayments directly from web users to content creators. (XXX DOUG ONE SENTENCE ABOUT COIL HERE?) A key point to make is that Coil uses XRP, which is a crypto coin that uses \u2018proof of stake\u2019. This is a system that has considerably better environmental implications than the older method used by coins such as Ethereum which uses a system called \u2018proof of work\u2019 and is the main blockchain used when creating NFT\u2019s. We are immensely proud to have worked with artists Melanie King, Louise O\u2019Boyle, Olga Suchanova, Ronan Devlin and Colin Frank who have made a series of works that include the use of Coil. Each commission is available for you to view below. You can see most of each artwork for free, but you can also support the artist and see additional material if you have a Coil wallet. If you would like to set up a Coil wallet to see the full pieces go HERE and follow the instructions (XXX DOUG ARE THERE ANY SIMPLE ONLINE INSTRUCTIONS FOR SETTING UP A COIL WALLET FOR THE VIEWER, I CAN'T FIND ANY!!) Thank you to the artists who worked with us and to the development team. And, thank you to Mozilla Foundation and Coil who made this version of Mural and these commissions possible through their generous support."),n.createElement(p,{onSlideChange:r}),n.createElement(d,i))))}}}]);
