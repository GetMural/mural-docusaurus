We did not change anything from a default Wordpress installation. All the steps provided here should be within reach of a non-technical Wordpress website owner. You will need to be logged in as an admin in order to make these changes.\\n\\nLet\'s look at what the actual requirements are. The first requirement is a method of uploading the necessary Mural files to the server and the second is a way of integrating those files into the posts and pages of a site.\\n\\n<a href=\\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-file-manager/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\\">WP File Manager</a> is a free and fully featured file manager. You can install it directly into your Wordpress via the Plugins Manager which you can find via `Plugins > Add New` and searching for it in the search bar.\\n\\n![Screenshot of WP File Manager](./assets/wp-file-manager.jpg)\\n\\nOnce WP File Manager is installed, our suggestion is to create a `stories` folder in your `wp-content` folder to store all of your Mural stories in. You can drag an entire folder structure onto the File Manager interface but to begin with we would suggest using the upload button.\\n\\n![Screenshot of WP File Manager Extract Files From Archive menu option](./assets/wp-extract-files-from-archive.jpg)\\n\\nUpload a Mural .zip file into the `/stories` directory. You can extract the files by right-clicking on the .zip file and selecting `Extract files from archive -> New folder`. Give your new directory a name and it will extract all the files from inside the Mural .zip file into that directory.\\n\\n![Screenshot of WP File Manager\'s selection info popup](./assets/wp-selection-info.jpg)\\n\\nOptionally, you can copy the directory\'s URL by right-clicking your directory and selecting the last item, `Get info & Share`, which opens up a window called Selection Info. There you can copy the path to your directory.\\n\\nYour new story is now available directly at `www.yourwebsite.com/wp-content/stories/your-mural-story/`. Be sure to test that it works by opening that URL in your browser before moving on to the next step.\\n\\nNow we have to install <a href=\\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/page-links-to/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\\">Page Links To</a> in exactly the same way that we installed WP File Manager, via the Plugins Manager, which you can find via `Plugins > Add New` and searching for it in the search bar.\\n\\nOnce `Page Links To` is installed, you\'ll want to advertise your new Mural story to your audience. The way to doing that is to create a normal blog post by going to `Blog Posts -> Add New`. Add a featured image that you\'d like to represent your new content in your site\'s post or blog list. Don\'t forget to write a short introductory text to your new content which will also display.\\n\\n![Screenshot of Page Links To](./assets/wp-page-links-to.jpg)\\n\\nFinally paste the link you saved above into the `Page Links to` field in your post editor. Mural stories use a custom URL, so select `A custom URL` and then paste the URL in the field. The `Page Links To` plugin replaces the usual Wordpress blog post with the URL you specified, but keeps all the other fields for things like the front page.\\n\\n![Screenshot of a our sample Wordpress front page](./assets/wp-front-page-screenshot.jpg)\\n\\nPublish your post. Now when you visit your site you should see your new post title, image, and description as per normal on pages like the front page, but when you click on the entry will be taken to your Mural story. `Page Links To` also handles your blog post forwarding so you don\'t need to worry about anybody accidentally ending up at your placeholder post.\\n\\nFinally don\'t forget to turn on the auto update for your new plugins to ensure your site\'s security.\\n\\nIt really is as easy as that."},{"id":"/2020/10/24/grant-for-the-web","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2020/10/24/grant-for-the-web","source":"@site/blog/2020-10-24-grant-for-the-web.md","title":"Mural selected for Grant for the Web funding","description":"Mural has been selected as a Mid Level Grantee in the Grant for the Web program, jointly administered by Mozilla, Creative Commons and Coil.","date":"2020-10-24T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"October 24, 2020","tags":[],"readingTime":1.24,"truncated":true,"authors":[{"name":"Douglas Arellanes","url":"https://twitter.com/dougiegyro"}],"prevItem":{"title":"Mural and Wordpress","permalink":"/blog/2020/11/23/mural-and-wordpress"},"nextItem":{"title":"Mural at Media Party 2020","permalink":"/blog/2020/09/23/media-party-2020"}},"content":"Mural has been selected as a <a href=\\"https://www.grantfortheweb.org/blog/2020-mid-grantees\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">Mid Level Grantee</a> in the <a href=\\"https://www.grantfortheweb.org\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\\">Grant for the Web</a> program, jointly administered by Mozilla, Creative Commons and Coil.\\n\\nOur project, titled \\"Web Monetization in the Arts\\" seeks to implement support for the emerging Web Monetization Protocol in Mural, as well as doing outreach work to people in the arts community.

But one of the areas of greatest disappointment we\u2019ve had has always been the way they work with visual content \u2014 the furthest most CMSes will go is to create a slideshow or embed media such as a video.\\n\\nIt\u2019s 2018. We have cars that drive themselves, but the best visuals we get on web pages are slideshows. Something is wrong here.\\n\\nWe made Mural as a specific tool for a specific purpose: To present visual content with maximum impact. How we decided to achieve this turned out to be a very interesting exercise.\\n\\nMural had its start as a visual theme for a CMS called Newscoop, but to get it to work, users had to go through a great deal of pain. The CMS backend had to be hacked to within an inch of its life. Learning how to set up the server environment was a deeply Linux-heavy affair, and then users had to first learn the ins-and-outs of first the CMS, then the peculiarities of the theme. Users wailed and gnashed their teeth, but in the end they put up with it because the theme looked good once everything was in place.\\n\\nThe experience led to our first decision: In order to make a tool that truly works with visual content, we had to get away from the mentality that everything an organization does must be in one single CMS.\\n\\nThere are quite a few good CMS themes for outputting big visuals \u2014 Snowball for Wordpress is an example \u2014 but the problem isn\u2019t with the theme, it\u2019s with the backend. The Wordpress admin interface isn\u2019t really isn\u2019t made for working with visual content, and rearranging content can be tedious. This may change with initiatives like Wordpress\u2019 Gutenberg editor \u2014 and we certainly hope so.\\n\\nThis led us to think: If we got away from the CMS, we could better understand the workflow of visual longform projects, which tend to be one-off efforts, assembled once and never updated again.\\n\\nThere was another plus. We could make the longform stories into static files, which would help to simplify things greatly on the technical side. With our output as static files, we wouldn\u2019t need a dynamic server, with all of the overhead that managing one entails. In fact, we could go serverless if we wanted to. With static pages, organizations can publish their stories just about anywhere, and for less money and trouble than a CMS.\\n\\nTo be clear, strong visuals don\u2019t require static pages. But static pages definitely makes the process simpler for less-technical users, and because time is money, we\u2019re saving both.\\n\\nIt turns out we aren\u2019t alone in thinking like this. The Chicago Tribune explored static HTML pages with its <a href=\\"http://www.tarbell.io/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">Tarbell</a> project (a seriously underrated project, IMHO). The New York Times tends to hand-code its special pages, and the LA Times has its <a href=\\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1IybYcc0eVL-Rchm7lEQNwrM-AHRfr_M8ewfGYYNjeu8/edit?pli=1#slide=id.p\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">Django Bakery</a> to generate static pages for its projects. You should check out the LA Times\u2019 presentation on the Django Bakery to see what I mean. And then there\u2019s <a href=\\"https://jekyllrb.com/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">Jekyll</a>, which is a whole universe unto itself.\\n\\nAll of these projects pointing to a similar conclusion: When it comes to visuals, it\u2019s easier to go outside the CMS than to get it to do what you want, especially when it has to do with anything outside existing templates.\\n\\n### Lesson 2: Focus on sequence\\n\\nWe started to think about what a specialized tool would look like if it were built for the single purpose of making visual longforms. The task could be broken down to three components \u2014 assembling, sequencing and presenting, and we started to look for effective metaphors.\\n\\nAs it turns out, one of the metaphors that works relatively well is presentation software. There are <a href=\\"https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-35038429\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">many faults to Powerpoint</a>, but one of the things it does very well is to help users lay out visual sequences. We liked the drag-and-drop metaphor they use for ordering screens, so that was our model. In our parlance, we call the workspace the Storyboard, and the individual components Items.\\nWe also wanted a tool that would bring about a shift in how video is treated in web storytelling. Many have spoken of a pivot to video, and while that hype wave has crested, the need still remains for media organizations to come up with more compelling uses for video. We think that full-screen, user-driven, sequential video could provide storytellers with some new ways to tell those stories.\\nIn this way, we have different Items for the type of content that\u2019s being presented. There are currently two video items, three static image items, two slideshow items and one text item:\\n\\n- Fullpage video\\n- Background video\\n- Image parallax\\n- Image audio\\n- Image background\\n- Vertical slideshow\\n- Horizontal slideshow\\n- Centred text\\n\\nEach of these items can then be used to present content, and the sequence of items can be rearranged by dragging and dropping.\\nLesson 3: Move to the desktop\\nWhen we started work on Mural, we originally intended it as server software. This would let us create a service for authoring content, and would let us use a centralized code base. But then we started thinking about the large amounts of files that would be used by such a service, and the storage and bandwidth implications of that, and we started to think otherwise. Also, there are still enough places in the world that don\u2019t have cheap and plentiful wireless broadband for sending and working with video.\\n\\nLuckily, there\u2019s been tremendous progress on an open source project called <a href=\\"https://www.electronjs.org\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">Electron</a>, which lets developers create desktop apps using JavaScript, HTML and CSS, and the same code can be used on Mac, Windows and Linux. We considered having both desktop and server versions of Mural, but for now we\u2019ve decided to concentrate on the desktop version, as it solves more of our users\u2019 pain points:\\n\\n- **Low barrier to entry** You don\u2019t need to know how to code to build a rich media site easily. Simply start writing and adding your media and the app will do the rest.\\n\\n- **It\u2019s faster** to work with a desktop program, because the user doesn\u2019t have to upload videos to a server before working with the story\\n\\n- **It\u2019s easier to make changes** on the desktop version, as there is no lag\\n\\n- Because **Mural outputs HTML, CSS and Javascript**, technically-savvy users can make additional changes before uploading by working in your favorite coding environment. We\u2019ve also discussed ways to support code insertion inside the Mural editor, so that a technically savvy user would be able to write (or copy) the code they need\\n\\n- **You have a choice of servers, and all of them are affordable.** We\u2019re using a mix of different servers for the stories we make with Mural, and all of them are quite affordable.\\n\\n- **Real world preview.** This allows for believable previewing of your work because what you see is being rendered in an actual browser in real time as you work.\\n\\n- **Keep agile.** The user can work on the go to build a story with their assets as they create them. No need to wait for phone signal and internet tethering to continue working.\\n\\n- The backend design we\u2019ve chosen also lets us make a **mobile app later on.** We\u2019d love to do this right away, but were faced with a very limited budget\\n\\n### Lesson 4: Simple things done well\\n\\nWe understand very well that working with video, especially optimizing video, can take a long time. We had a lot of debates about whether or not to include video conversion functionality in the editor, but decided against this because it would add a lot of complexity to the code. Instead we decided to highlight in our manual a number of different external tools that are already very good at converting video. We would, however, like to make it clearer to the user that they have to optimize their videos themselves, and will improve this in future versions. That said, working with video is definitely an area we\u2019re looking to improve.\\nWe do plan on adding support to Mural for integrating YouTube and Vimeo videos in a future release, and are interested in embed support for a number of different services \u2014 support for data visualization tools like D3 are also on our to-do list. In fact, one of the artists we worked with in testing Mural, Dominic Smith, has created a piece, [The Volunteers](https://stories.getmural.io/isisarts/thevolunteers/), in which all of the videos are served from Vimeo.\\n\\n### Lesson 5: Listening to and watching our users\\n\\nOne of the reasons we made Mural was so that journalists and people working in the arts would have the ability to better convey arts stories, which by their very nature are multimedia. Some of our earliest testers are artists themselves, and they\u2019ve used Mural both as a way to document their work and as an artistic medium in and of itself.\\n\\nWe\u2019ve listened to our users very carefully and have also watched them use Mural, and this has given us much clearer prioritization of our bugs and feature requests. We\u2019re big practitioners of Design Thinking, and we started the project with personae representing types of users, but over time these personae have been replaced with real users and their very real tasks, needs and pain points.\\nDesign Thinking also helped us to clarify and refine Mural\u2019s features and functionality, and we continue to follow its five primary steps: Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype and Test.\\n\\n### Lesson 6: Trust the community\\n\\nOne of our current discussions has to do with how to make Mural into a viable project that serves its community but also becomes a sustainable business. All of us on the Mural team are strong advocates of open source, and we\u2019re taking a leap of faith in starting a new business while keeping that commitment. We believe that once we get Mural our into users\u2019 hands, they\u2019ll start to get involved in improving it and developing it further, as well as using the services we offer based on the tool.\\n\\nWe plan to offer a number of paid services on top of Mural, including hosting, optimization, and development of new features. We also want to offer consulting and training to show users how to make the most of not only Mural, but also a number of related apps and services. It\u2019s cheesy to end this up this way, but it needs to be said: [Get in touch](mailto:getinfo@getmural.io) and we can work together to make it easier to tell visual stories!"},{"id":"/2017/07/06/introducing-mural","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2017/07/06/introducing-mural","source":"@site/blog/2017-07-06-introducing-mural.md","title":"Introducing Mural","description":"Imagine the scene: Two friends, Douglas Arellanes, (that\u2019s me) and Pete Haughie, are sitting in a bar on a Serbian mountaintop in April at 3am.

The wave of hype surrounding projects like New York Times\u2019 <a href=\\"http://www.nytimes.com/projects/2012/snow-fall/index.html#/?part=tunnel-creek\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">_Snowfall_</a> and <a href=\\"http://www.nytimes.com/newsgraphics/2013/10/27/south-china-sea/index.html\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">_Shark and Minnow_</a> and The Guardian\u2019s <a href=\\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/may/26/firestorm-bushfire-dunalley-holmes-family\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">_Firestorm_</a> has come and gone, and it\u2019s becoming fairly clear that only the biggest news organizations, with the technical capacity and budget to build multimedia projects from scratch, are able to do this on a regular basis. Some of the traditionally big digital players have tried with varying degrees of success to do longform digital media format. The BBC\u2019s <a href=\\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-sh/the_reykjavik_confessions\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">_The Reykjavik Confessions_</a> being a standout example of great content let down by less-than-great delivery.\\n\\nPete Haughie, Dominic Smith and I have been thinking about this for good long while now. When Pete and I worked together at <a href=\\"https://www.sourcefabric.org/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">Sourcefabric</a>, we were part of a team that worked on a project called <a href=\\"http://storyteller-dev.lab.sourcefabric.org/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">Storyteller</a>, which was initially nothing but a complicated theme for Newscoop, the CMS maintained by Sourcefabric. Storyteller had similar intentions, worked OK, and was used effectively by more than a few organizations, but it was soon clear to us that CMSes of any kind weren\u2019t really well-suited to this kind of work \u2014 the backend had to be pretty severely abused in order to arrange the content in a way that would work for this purpose and editing and to say maintenance and publishing became difficult would be an understatement.\\n\\nMany in the journalism/tech community have come to similar conclusions. A few years ago, I asked a data journalist what we as CMS makers could do to help their work. \u201cGet the hell out of our way,\u201d was the answer I got, and I couldn\u2019t help but laugh at the truth she was telling. There are other interesting projects that have served as inspiration. The <a href=\\"http://www.tarbell.io/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">Tarbell</a> project, originally by the Chicago Tribune news applications team, was a really interesting model for us, as it was one of the first \u2018NoCMS\u2019 projects we\u2019d seen. Tarbell makes it easy to publish static websites, which is useful especially in high-demand situations, as well as for situations where the content isn\u2019t likely to be updated.\\n\\nAt the same time, we\u2019re aware that although there are several very good services for hosting longform articles, we intend to improve on what they offer. We also aim to address a criticism made of many of the longform hosting services, to avoid \u2018vendor lock-in\u2019 and make it far easier for multimedia creators to export and transfer their work to other hosting providers and collaborators.\\nUnfortunately, due to a change in Sourcefabric\u2019s focus, work on Storyteller effectively stopped in late 2015, but Pete and I continued to talk about what could be done to make it easier to create and publish longform multimedia. In the meantime independently and unbeknownst to us, Dominic Smith had been doing a lot of work using Storyteller to publish multimedia longform articles documenting art projects in the North of England as part of the EU-funded Corners of Europe project, and his hard work and pained entreaties has served as an inspiration to continue work on these tools with him working alongside us.\\n\\nDominic, Pete and I decided to apply for a prototype grant from the Google Digital News Innovation fund in its third round, and I\u2019m happy to announce that as of today our project has been officially approved, so in coming weeks we will start work on a new project, which we are calling Mural, to create a new toolset to make it easier to make longform multimedia projects.\\nWe\u2019re looking forward to building Mural in the open, and as an open source project. While we have a number of ideas for what should be in the MVP version, we are also looking to partner with similarly-minded visual journalists, artists, storytellers, and developers. Please get in touch with us at info@getmural.io and get involved!"}]}')}}]);
