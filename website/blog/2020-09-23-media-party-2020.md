Recently Mural was just at <a href="https://mediaparty2020.sched.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Media Party 2020</a> where our own Douglas Arellanes was holding the session <a href="https://mediaparty2020.sched.com/event/drCY/construyendo-historias-visuales-sin-un-cms-usando-mural-building-visual-stories-without-a-cms-using-mural" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Building visual stories without a CMS using Mural</a>, while I was manning the chat answering all text based questions you had about Mural!

It was lovely to see the ~150 or so faces in the zoom session and perhaps countless others via facebook live streaming! For those of you who are interested to catch the workshop or perhaps find the slides, you can <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hackshackersba/videos/978576952547745/?vh=e&extid=NT0hVmLO4vlGGkxl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">find the workshop streamed on Facebook</a> or <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lvFCACO4LCVAZUYKxGPTewnFi-eqz5MdrJwwZbyPA0s/edit#slide=id.gcb9a0b074_1_0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">view the slides via Google Docs</a>
