## Image Background

This editor pane is where you enter information for the Image Background view type.

In it you will find fields for the following:

* Fullpage
* Navigation Title
* Title
* Subtitle
* Text
* Offset Portrait Video
* Image Sources
* Audio Sources

### Fullpage

This checkbox determines whether the final Mural story output will be more focused upon the image or the text. If the element is checked then your text will be forced towards the bottom of the Mural story window to allow more space for the image.

### Navigation Title

This is what the name of this view output will be called in the Mural story navigation menu. This does not have to be the same as the title. 
Navigation is not a mandatory field and it can be left blank (not recommended) but it can also be supressed from the navigation (recommended if the field is blank).

### Title

This is what you would like the title of the Mural story output of this editor pane to display.

### Subtitle

This is the subtitle that displays under the main Mural story output of this editor pane.

### Text

This is the main text of the Mural story output of this editor pane. It is in rich text and can be formatted to include links, bold, italicised, and other text modifications.

### Offset Portrait Image

If your background image source is very wide and you are unhappy with the default central positioning of it when viewed in portrait mode then you can move it using the Offset Portait Image fields. The options available to you are `Left` - position the image to the extreme left of the Mural window, `Center` - position the image to the center of the Mural window which is also the same as the default positioning, `Right` - position the image to the extreme right of the Mural window, `Custom Offset` - here you can use the slider to change the offset value to anywhere between extreme left and extreme right and the value will be shown to you in terms of percentage.

### Image Sources

This is where you would choose the images to use for the background of the Mural story output. You do not need to have the same image for each dimension of Mural window but the Offset Portrait Image value will be used for all of them.

The width in pixels of each breakpoint of a Mural story window are:
* 768px
* 992px
* 1200px

### Audio Sources

This is where can set an audio file to accompany your Image Background if you wish. The audio file will loop infinitely.
