### Alt text

There are two fields that allow you to resize your image, vertically and horizontally. This is set to the full width of the text area by default.

### Align

left, center or right - this places the image either left, center or right in the text column. You adjust the alignment by first clicking on the image, then a popup menu appears with 'L' (for left), 'C' (for center) and 'R' for right.

## Black text on white background

This makes the text black on a white background when checked, or white on a black background when it is not checked.
