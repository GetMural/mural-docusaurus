#H1 Mural documentation stylesheet

This document is where we track our own terminology and set the styles used in our documentation and communications.

#H2 Terminology

#H3 Mural stories
Whenever possible, we should refer to the stories produced by the Mural editor as "Mural stories". This will help branding but also avoid confusion.

#H3 Search engines
When we refer to search engines and social media platforms, be sure to mention the privacy-friendly and open source alternatives. So when the instinct is to use `Google`, use `Google or Duck Duck Go`, as well as `Facebook, Twitter or Mastodon.`
