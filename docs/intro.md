Visual storytelling is different from writing in text only, and we believe it requires a purpose-built tool to work with the richness and power of multimedia.

Mural is a tool for visual storytelling. It’s a program that helps you sequence your visual story, and then generates everything needed for that story to be displayed on most modern web browsers and served from any web server.

When a story is made with Mural, its visual elements are displayed at full screen by default, letting the strength and richness of your work shine through. Images can be combined with sound, videos combined with text, and numerous other combinations are possible. Rearrange your sequences with a simple drag and drop.

## What you see is what you get

See the way your story will look, test out all of the elements, and make changes if necessary before it’s uploaded to the web.

### Journalism

Make better use of the power of visual storytelling. Present complex stories in long form with the strong visuals they deserve. Set your photo and video journalists free.

### Art

### Storytelling

Mural can be used effectively anywhere where a story needs to be told across media. Present your organization's stories in a visually powerful way quickly, easily and in a cost-effective manner.

### Advertising and Marketing
