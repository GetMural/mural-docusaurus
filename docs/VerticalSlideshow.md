A Vertical slideshow item refers to a collection of images with captions that can be scrolled through in a set - each slide "sticking" to the top of the screen until the following slide replaces it.

`Slide [+]` Clicking this adds another slide to the slideshow. You can have as many slides in the slideshow as you want. For optimal results large slideshows are discouraged as currently all images for a slideshow are bulk loaded as a set.
