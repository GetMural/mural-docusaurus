An Image Audio item is a still image that can play audio in the background. This is useful for ambient, environmental sound, or for sound material with images attached. An audio file attached to an Image Audio item will loop until the user scrolls away to advance to the next item.

## Audio Sources

Both audio formats have a preview window available. At least one format is required - these days all modern browsers play mp3 so ogg is not strictly necessary. The audio file will loop infinitely.

### MP3

This is where you select the sound file you want that is in the MP3 format.

### Ogg

This is where you select the sound file you want that is in the Ogg format.
