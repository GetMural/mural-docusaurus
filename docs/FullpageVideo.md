The Fullpage video item refers to a section of your Mural story where there is a video that takes up the entire screen, and which can have video controls. Note: You can have a headline on a fullpage video item, but cannot have body text.
Fullpage video items have the following fields to work with:

## Fullpage

When this is checked, the video takes up the entire page. When it is not checked, the video is displayed at its original size.

## Title

this is where you write your title for the item, such as a headline.

## Text

this is where you write the body text for the page

## Video sources

### MP4

this is where you input your MP4 video file

### Webm

this is where you input your uploaded Webm file

Both video formats have a preview window available.

## Poster Image

This is a still image that loads before the video and serves as an alternate.
