Mural's session <a href="https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/making-open-multimedia-stories-with-mural/46613" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Making open multimedia stories with Mural</a> at <a href="https://www.mozillafestival.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mozilla Festival</a> 2019 was a lot of fun for us here at Mural. It was the first time Doug, Pete, and I had been together in the same room for ages!

The goal of our session was for participants to be able to build their own rich multimedia stories using available tools such as mobile phones, open source editing tools, and the Mural multimedia story tool. Doug opened up with an introduction to visual scrollytelling in the field of journalism, before we dove in to how to make your own visual stories using the Mural editing software.

I was showcasing the work on the new version of the Mural editor which will be much more responsive to your edits with the technology choices of `React` and `mobx-state-tree`. We are experimenting with a variety of ways to make creating your visual stories even easier - one of them being using open source image cropping and machine vision tools such as <a href="http://thumbor.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thumbor</a>. The new editor is still in its early stages as we explore its direction here at Mural.
